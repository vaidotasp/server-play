Tables

1. Users
2. Coffee making methods
3. Favorites (which user likes which coffee making method(s)) -> associative table

One user can have multiple favorites
One coffee making method can have multi users but ultimately it is singular

User 1 -> method 1,2,3,4
Method 2 -> User 1,2,3,4


What is a constraint??
explain foreign key thing like i'm five and use.
